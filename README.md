# SudokuSolver
Sudoku is a logic game where you want to insert the numbers from 1 to 9 in a 9x9 matrix, divided in turn into 9 sub-matrices (boxes) 3x3, where some numbers are already present in some elements of the matrix. Each row, column, and sub-array must contain each number only once. For the game to be valid, the numbers already present must ensure that there is one and only one solution.
